						<h3>Volunteer</h3>
						<p>All sorts of people volunteer for many different reasons, but one thing that unites them all is that they find it challenging, rewarding and varied.</p>
						<p>CAB volunteering really does provides an opportunity to learn new skills and to develop existing ones. With so many different volunteering opportunities on offer, there's bound to be something to suit you. Nearly one-third of the volunteers who leave the service each year use their experience to secure paid work so there's more to volunteering with us than you might think!</p>
						<p>Every Citizens Advice Bureau is a registered charity and over 20,000 of the people involved in the service are trained volunteers, helping people to resolve over 5.7 million new problems a year. </p>
						<p>We need people of all ages and backgrounds and are always looking for people with skills in other languages in addition to English to train as advisers.</p>
						<p>If you decide to become a CAB adviser your training is accredited by the Open College Network, and is respected and valued throughout the advice sector.</p>
						<p>All our volunteer roles will enable you to develop specific expertise. For example, you might improve your IT and organisational skills as an administrator or learn how to deal with the publications and leaflets as an admin volunteer.</p>
						<p>You'll get the chance to develop your skills in a number of valuable areas, like communication and dealing with the public, as well as increasing your self-confidence through practical hands-on experience.</p>
						<p>There are opportunities for everyone and you never stop learning!</p>
						<p>It's also a chance to put the skills and experience you already have to good use by helping others in your local community.</p>
						<p>Meet new people - for many people, the best thing about volunteering for the CAB is getting to meet a wide range of people and make new friends. There is a real team spirit at CAB, and we provide a supportive environment to make sure that you get the most out of your time with us.</p>
						<p>Fit volunteering in with the rest of your life - some roles are more flexible than others. We'll do our best to find a role for you that fits in with your interests, and we'll be as flexible as possible in enabling you to volunteer at the times that suit you best. Many of our trustees, for example, fit their volunteering around full time jobs.</p>
						<p>You won't be out of pocket - bureaux will cover any travel costs you have to pay and some bureaux are also able to pay for other expenses such as child care costs.</p>
						<p>If you could help us to help others please contact: Jan Stewart (District Manager) on 01304 374333 or by email: <a href="maito:districtmanager@dealcab.cabnet.org.uk">districtmanager@dealcab.cabnet.org.uk</a></p>
