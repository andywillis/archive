# Responsive Hangman

[http://uws-hangman.herokuapp.com/](http://uws-hangman.herokuapp.com/) (it takes a while for the Heroku dyno to ramp up - have patience).

Responsive Hangman game using React, Redux, Flexbox, and Canvas.

Fetches a new word from a public dictionary API with each new game.

Still to do:

* Specific keyboard entry as well as tab focusing
* Fix canvas issue
* Improve accessibility
